# Object-Oriented Design 
### - Learning to program with design patterns.

## The Project
Developing one single object-oriented program; Point Of Sale.
This project is based on assignments for a course in 'Object-Oriented Design' given at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

## Content and learning outcomes
### Course contents
Examples of fields that are treated:
* Object-oriented design and design pattern  
* Architecture and architectural patterns  
* Guidelines for object-oriented programming for example refactoring and unit testing
* UML (Unified Modeling Language)  
* Object-oriented analysis
### Intended learning outcome
One shall be able to 
* develop an object-oriented programme by applying established guidelines for object-oriented architecture, design and programming
* discuss the quality of a programme and then refer to established guidelines for object-oriented architecture, design and programming
* interpret and clarify a given specification by applying established guidelines for analysis.
